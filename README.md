# Password-Based-Locking-System
8051, Stepper motor-based locking system

This project aims at utilizing an 8051 microcontroller with a 4x4 Keypad, 16x2 LCD Display, and stepper motor to 
create a low-cost locking system for safes, doors, etc.

The following repository contains the proteus connection diagram of the circuit, the assembly program file, and a flowchart image containing the working.

*KEIL uVision was used for compilation and building.*

# Flowchart

A Flowchart is added to understand the system flow.
